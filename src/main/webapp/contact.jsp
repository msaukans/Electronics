Redmond Electric is a family run business.  In the era of the big electrical retail chains, we can pride ourselves of our personal customer service. As a member of the Euronics Electrical Group we have the purchasing power to buy and sell products at a very competitive price.

Redmond Electric has been a part of Gorey’s business landscape for the past 40 years.  With its modest beginnings on 91 Main Street, its owner, Michael Redmond Snr. has a vision to sell the very best of electrical goods at competitive prices. The company quickly established itself as a leader in its market in the south east. The business was built on service and value…………..

In October 2001, the business saw the untimely passing of its founder, Mick Snr…  His son, Michael Jnr. had just left college and started to work full time in the business.  Soon after Mick’s oldest daughter Nicola decided to return home and join her brother in developing and managing the family business.  Both were in their 20’s, but age proved no barrier to continue the vision and the success that is Redmond Electric.  After 18 months in the business together, the shop underwent a massive refurbishment due to the ever growing demand of this successful business.

In 2005 Redmond Electric joined Euronics, the largest electrical buying group in Europe.  The shop on the Main Street soon became too small for their requirements and in 2007 moved to a new 10,000sq foot purpose built retail unit located at WFC Retail Park. With the new shop offering bigger displays and better layout, the business went from strength to strength carrying all the top brands on the market.

Our knowledgeable staff are continually trained and updated in the latest technology which ensures that every customer will get the best product suited to them.

We also offer an after sales service including – delivery, recycling, installation, servicing and repairs.

The Redmond family and their long serving staff who continue to work for our customers have not lost sight of our core values…. to sell the very best of electrical goods at competitive prices with personal customer service.  This is the foundation of our business that has served us and our customers in the past and will continue to serve us in the future.
